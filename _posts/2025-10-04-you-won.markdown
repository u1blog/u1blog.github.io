We can get stuck in a loop of always striving harder, working for more, wanting more.

Nobody ever tells you when you've won! When you can stop scrambling. It's time to relax and enjoy.

It's very easy to always be working for a time in the future when you will be able to enjoy things. Sacrifice now for later. But delayed gratification taken to the extreme is no gratification at all.

I'm calling it. I'm telling myself 'You won!'. You've done enough. Now's the time to start living. Start enjoying.
